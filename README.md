# World_Weather_Analysis
       This project is about adding the weather description to the weather data for the PlanMyTrip app. The beta testers will use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta testers will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, the beta testers will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
